Install Node.js and npm (if theyâ€™re not already installed):

Download the latest version of Node.js from Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager).

Copy the folder to you local system and run 

npm install

This installs all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Start the Development Server:

Run the following command to start the React development server:

npm start

This will open the app on http://localhost:3000 by default.

Edit and Save Changes:

You can edit files in the src directory. Changes will automatically reload in the browser with hot-reloading.
Stop the Server:

To stop the server, press Ctrl + C in the terminal.
Additional Notes:

If another app is using port 3000, React will prompt to use a different port.
For production, you can build the app with:

npm run build
